# US Demographic and Political Preference Analysis

A comprehensive spatial analysis of US demographic characteristics and voting behavior using R and machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between demographic factors (race, income) and voting patterns across US counties using advanced spatial analysis methods and machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features

- **Spatial Data Processing**: Integration of multiple shapefiles and demographic datasets
- **Statistical Analysis**: OLS regression, spatial lag/error models, and correlation analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest and XGBoost models with spatial feature engineering
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps and statistical plots
- **Data Quality Control**: Comprehensive data validation and cleaning procedures

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Git

### Required R Packages

```r
install.packages(c(
  "jsonlite", "dplyr", "readxl", "tidyr", "sf", 
  "spdep", "spatialreg", "ggplot2", "cowplot", 
  "leaflet", "randomForest", "xgboost", "caret"
))
```

### Data Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us-demographic-political-analysis.git
cd us-demographic-political-analysis
```

2. Copy your data files to the project directory:
   - Place all `.xlsx`, `.csv` files in the root directory
   - Create subdirectories for shapefiles: `tiger/`, `smallshp/`, `small_tiger/`

3. Ensure your data structure matches the expected format:
   - `race_2.xlsx`: Demographic data by county
   - `gov.csv`: Election results with county FIPS codes
   - `fips.csv`: FIPS code mappings
   - Shapefile directories with complete .shp, .dbf, .shx, .prj files

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. Open `us_demographic_political_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio
2. Install required packages (if not already installed)
3. Run the entire notebook or execute chunks individually

### Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning** (Sections 1-2)
   - Loads demographic, voting, and spatial data
   - Performs data cleaning and standardization

2. **Spatial Data Processing** (Sections 3-5)
   - Handles shapefile integration
   - Performs spatial interpolation for Connecticut case study

3. **Statistical Analysis** (Sections 6-8)
   - Regression modeling
   - Correlation analysis
   - Data quality assessment

4. **Visualization** (Sections 9-10)
   - Scatter plots and geographic maps
   - Population density visualizations

5. **Spatial Analysis** (Section 11)
   - Spatial autocorrelation testing (Moran's I)
   - Spatial lag and error models

6. **Machine Learning** (Section 12)
   - Random Forest and XGBoost models
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model comparison and evaluation

## 📈 Key Results

### Statistical Findings

- **Demographic Impact**: Strong correlations between racial composition and voting patterns
- **Income Effects**: Significant relationship between salary income and party preferences
- **Spatial Patterns**: Confirmed spatial autocorrelation in voting behavior

### Model Performance

| Model | Democratic R² | Republican R² |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Random Forest | 0.XXX | 0.XXX |
| XGBoost | 0.XXX | 0.XXX |

*Note: Actual values will be populated when you run the analysis*
